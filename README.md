## How to Run the Server

0. if you cloned this repository, make sure to create a file called `.env` to store a variable called `PORT` and give it a value (free port, like 3000), and MONGO_URI and give it a URI.

1. Run `npm install` to install all the needed dependencies.

2. Simply run `npm start`.

## Where's the database?

You will have to install `mongod` (self-hosted MongoDB Server) on your machine and run `mongod` in your terminal. After that, you will be able to connect to MongoDB server from `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/`
